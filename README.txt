bash_controls
========================================
Aimed at notebook users, bash_controls is a set of bash scripts
allowing to control various pieces of the machine. They can be
used from the commandline, but are even more helpfun when bound
in your WM settings to the Fn-keys.

The set consists of:
  - batmon: battery monitor
    A simple script to check the state of the battery.

  - bricon: brightness control
    A script to change the backlight brightness.

  - dispswitch: display switcher
    A script to switch between possible display configurations.

  - howmanyinternets: internet usage meter
    A script to keep track of your internet usage so you won't
    blow your data cap in a single evening.

  - volcon: volume control
    A script to change the speaker/microphone volume.
