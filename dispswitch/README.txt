dispswitch
========================================
Usage: dispswitch

A script to switch to the next possible configuration of displays.
In the simple case of a laptop with a single monitor connected,
this will cycle through:
1. Built-in display only
2. External monitor only
3. Both displays active 

----------------------------------------

dispswitch uses xrandr to perform all operations, so the program
must be installed for it to work correctly.
